The following values were found as least composite number (~20 runs):
k=1 - 9
k=2 - 15
k=3 - 33

The value for k has a direct influence of the size of different values being
used for the base of the Fermat's little theorem. There is a possiblity that a
integer p will pass the test while its not a prime these are called probable
primes. The bigger the input for k the more base values will be tested to provide
more certainty on the conclussion if a number is indeed a prime.
