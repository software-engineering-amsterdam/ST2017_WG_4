Read or reread Chapter 4 of The Haskell Road, and make a list of questions on specific points that cause difficulty of understanding.

H4.1
- Russel Paradox & exercise 4.7?? (p. 120)

1. In example 4.6, why does F not belong to F in the example?
1. Why does `halts` take 2 arguments: `funny` and `funny`? What are the types of arguments in this reasoning?
1. How to show that a set containing an empty set ({0}) and a set containing a set, containing an empty set ({{0}}) are different?
1. How to determine how many elements a power set has of a set with n elements?
1. Would it be possible to prove that if every number in the domain of input for the program, after transforming using the following formula: n1 = 3n0 + 1, converges, at some point to a power of 2 then the program can halt?
